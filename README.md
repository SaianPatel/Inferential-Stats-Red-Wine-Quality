# Inferential-Stats-Red-Wine-Quality
The repository for an Inferential Statistics project using a dataset on Red Wine Quality.

The notebooks are separated as follows.

The dataset is located in the "Data" folder.

Example output csv files from the code are also stored.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms.
- Summary Statistics.
- Outlier Identification.

## 2. Verifying the CLT & LLN
- Empirical verification of the CLT and LLN.

## 3.1. Hypothesis Testing - Single-Tailed
- Testing whether the mean pH is higher than a hypothesized value.
- Confidence Intervals.

## 3.2. Hypothesis Testing - Two-Sample
- Testing whether the mean alcohol content differs between high- and low-quality wines.
- Power Analysis.

## 4. Correlation
- Correlation heatmap.
- Scatter plots.
- Consideration of outliers.

## 5.1. Univariate Regression
- Predicting wine quality using a single predictor.
- CLT considerations in regression.

## 5.2. Multivariate Regression
- Predicting wine quality using multiple predictors.
- VIF analysis.
- Testing the model.
- Predictor sweeps.
